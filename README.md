# Periwinkle (beta)

This soft dark theme is great for those who love color but want something a bit more easy on the eyes.

üöß Periwinkle is still in development so if you come across anything please let me know. Your feedback is very helpful. Thank you!

Why Periwinkle?
I created Periwinkle because I was tired of seeing the same traditional dark themes in the marketplace. I wanted to see more soft dark themes, themes that are not completely dark but not completely light either. At the time I also chose this color because I wanted it to match my favorite Logitech keyboard that's periwinkle üòÖ

Features:
Variants (Coming Soon!) I‚Äôm currently working on additional variants to make Periwinkle even more versatile:

High Contrast: For improved visibility in low-light conditions.

Light Mode: A brighter alternative for those who prefer light themes.

High Contrast Light Mode: A high-contrast version of the light theme for maximum accessibility.

Stay tuned for updates on Twitter/X and Threads: @itskarelleh
